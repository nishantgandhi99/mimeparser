 * original InputStream.  The new InputStream will access the same
 * underlying data as the original, without copying the data. <p>

 * Note that implementations of this interface must ensure that the
 * <code>close</code> method does not close any underlying stream
 * that might be shared by multiple instances of <code>SharedInputStream</code>
 * until all shared instances have been closed.
